This repository contains implementation of ML algorithms from scratch or lower-level code in python. The python code featured are inspired partly by the book [Neural Network From Scratch](https://nnfs.io/). Original work has been done to the best of abilities.

The codes are for academic purposes and highly-optimized numpy and tensorflow functions should be used in their place.

#### Handy Tutorials
This contains jupyter notebooks on introduction to some concepts that are important. Examples on these tutorials are on TensorFlow Extended (TFX), TensorFlow JS and other important libraries & frameworks.
