This directory contains implementations of data structures and algorithms in Python, JavaScript and C++.

The Python codes are heavily inspired by the book [Data Structures and Algorithms in Python](https://www.amazon.com/Structures-Algorithms-Python-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118290275) by Michael T. Goodrich et al with a lot of original thought on the implementations.

The C++ codes are heavily inspired by the book [Data Structures Using C++, 2nd edition](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Using-D-Malik/dp/0324782012) by D.S. Malik with a lot of original thought on the implementations.
